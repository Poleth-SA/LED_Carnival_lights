# Project-for-CPSC-440
A small simple project using Rasberry pi

Project 440 - LED Carnival

Hardware Used: A Laptop, Raspberry pie, LED bulds, Male to female jumper wires, 180 ohm resistors and Breadboard.

Software Used: Thonny and Python

Description: First time using hardware, I tried to so something simple yet interesting enough to present to the class. Pretty much program some LED bulds to light up in different pattern that are quite common to see when one goes to the Carnival and pays attention to the lights on displays/rides.
